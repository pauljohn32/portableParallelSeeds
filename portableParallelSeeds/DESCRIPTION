Title: Allow replication of simulations on parallel and serial
    computers.
Type: Package
Author: Paul E. Johnson <pauljohn@ku.edu>
Description: Creates, saves, reloads, and selects among streams of
    random numbers.  This implements one approach for exact replication
    of simulations that are conducted on different compute systems.
    From a batch of thousands of simulations, one can select any
    arbritray "run" of the model and re-initialize it (replicate it) in
    isolation. Why is this useful? Suppose a simulation requires an
    exercise to be conducted 2000 times for various randomly-generated
    data. We want to be sure we get the same results if we run that in
    a compute cluster or if we run on a single workstation. It is thus
    necessary to create a matrix of random generator states (loosely
    referred to as seeds, but they really are random generator states),
    one for each "run", and then conduct the simulation so that the
    saved seeds are properly put to user when a particular run is to be
    executed. This framework allows each "run" to draw from several
    separate streams of random numbers.
